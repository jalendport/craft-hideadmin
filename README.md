# Hide Admin plugin for Craft CMS 3

Hide Admin hides admin users from non-admin users, which is useful if you want to hand-over the responsibility of user management without including access to admin users.

## Overview

- Admin users aren't included in the users table for non-admin users
- Non-admin users cannot view or edit admin users

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.1.0 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, either install via the plugin store or follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require lukeyouell/craft-hideadmin

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Hide Admin.
